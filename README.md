# The Six W's About R packages

Many R users struggle with R packages. The problem is largely because the useful information is scattered or burried in text written mainly for developers, the fairly experienced fellows who create R packages (e.g. the [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) book by Hadley Wickham, and [these slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/ubc-stat545-2015-writing-your-first-r-package) by Jenny Bryan). This document helps R users to understand and use R packages by briefly answering the [Six W's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws) about R packages, targetting specifically an imaginary R user with no background.

__Definition__. An R package is a kind of _Inflatable Castle_: A castle that inflates. An _Inflatable Castle_ can be big and red, but it can't have a massive hole -- the hole won't let it inflate, so if your castle has a massive hole it is no longer an _Inflatable Castle_. (Sad, I know). Similarly, an R package is a very specific collection of files and folders. To meet the definition of "R package", the names and structure of those files and folders have to meet some expectations. If you doon't meet them, you have files and folders but not an R package.

__Source versus built__. 

Can you have a deflated _Inflatable Castle_? Yes you can. The deflated _Inflatable Castle_ isn't good for jumping on, but it is good for other things, like cleaning it. Similarly, to clean or maintain an R package you need its "deflated" or source state. The source of a package has all you need to build it but you can't use it for its main purpose until you actually build it. This built, "inflated", state of an R package is what you use to have fun.
