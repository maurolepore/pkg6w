# The [Six Ws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws) About R packages

Many R users struggle with R packages. The problem is largely because the useful information is scattered or burried in text written mainly for developers, the fairly experienced fellows who create R packages (e.g. the [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) book by Hadley Wickham, and [these slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/ubc-stat545-2015-writing-your-first-r-package) by Jenny Bryan). This document helps R users to understand and use R packages by briefly answering the [Six W's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws) about R packages, targetting specifically an imaginary R user with no background.
